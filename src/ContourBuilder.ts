   * vectorized.
   *
   * Setting it to:
   * - 1 ensure that an aliased edge won't be split to more edges.
   * - more that 1 will reduce the number of edges but the obstacles edges
   *   will be followed with less accuracy.
   * - less that 1 might be more accurate but it may try to follow the

   *
   * Values under 1 can be useful in specific cases:
   * - when edges are horizontal or vertical, there is no aliasing so value
   *   near 0 can do better results.
   * - when edges are 45Â° multiples, aliased vertex won't be farther than

    //    location facing its original direction.
